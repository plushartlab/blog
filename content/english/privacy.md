This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share information when you purchase an item from us, contact us, or otherwise use our services through Plushartlab.com, Etsy.com or its related sites and services.

### What data do we collect? ###
To fulfil your order, you must provide  us with certain information, such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide  us with additional personal information (for a custom order, for example), if you contact  us through Etsy or plushartlab.com.

### How do we collect your data? ###
You directly provide PlushArtLab with the data we collect or indirectly via Etsy. We collect and process data when you:
Register online or place an order for any of our products or services.
Voluntarily complete a customer survey or provide feedback on any of our message boards or via email.
Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies.

### How will we use your data? ###

PlushArtLab collects your data so that we can:

* Process your order and manage your account.
* Email you with special offers on other products and services we think you might like.

We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:

* Etsy. We share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with my obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.

* Service providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.

* Business transfers. If We sell or merge my business, We may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.

* Compliance with laws. We may collect, use, retain, and share your information if We have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.

### Why do we need your information and how do we use it? ###

We rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:

* as needed to provide our services, such as when we use your information to fulfil your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support;

* when you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for our mailing list;

* if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and

* as necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving our services. We use your information to provide the services you requested and in my legitimate interest to improve our services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. We use your information as necessary to comply with our obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.

### How do we store your data? ###

We may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If we are deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, we rely on Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud is Privacy Shield certified.

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with services and as described in the Privacy Policy. However, we may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. We generally keep your data for the following time periods: 4 years.

### Marketing ###

If you have agreed to receive marketing, you may always opt out at a later date.
