I've been experimenting with 2D patterns that yield various 3D shapes. 

I tried the baseball method, where two figure eight or dumbbell shaped pieces are sewn together to yield a sphere. 

I tried two versions:
(1) Two circles placed adjacent to one another to form a figure eight (1).
(2) Two circles placed at a distance equal to the length of the circle edge enclosed by the connecting lines (2).

{{< figure src="/images/sphere2.png" title="2" >}}

I will start with the first version (1). I got this pattern by putting four circles together and using the edges of the lateral circles to form the sides.

I sewed two identical pieces together like a baseball.

The result was a ball with this shape (3). The Blue arrows show the corresponding part on the original pattern.

The second version was made by putting four circles equidistant from a centre point, and using the edges of the lateral circles to form the sides.

I sewed two identical pieces together like a baseball.

The result was a ball with this shape (5). â€‹ The Blue arrows show the corresponding part on the original pattern.

{{< figure src="/images/sphere9.png" title="5" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/sphere10.png" title="6" >}}

Results are shown here.

For spheres, I will use version 2.
