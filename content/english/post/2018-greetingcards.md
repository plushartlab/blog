I've had some of my hand embroidery pieces turned into greeting cards. Have a look [here] (https://www.etsy.com/shop/plushartlab/)! They are printed on heavy paper with a smooth, satin finish. Each card comes with a kraft paper envelope and a cellophane sleeve. The inside is unlaminated, so it's easy to write on. 

The Drosophila melanogaster mutants cards include:
curled [cu]
Ski wings [Si]
taxi [tx]
vestigial [vg]
cut-6 [ct6]
vestigial-strap [vgs]
apterous [ap3]
outstretched small eye-outstretched [oso]
cut-8 [ct8]
white [w] 
There is also a wild type Female.
