Demelza Hospice Care for Children provides tremendously valuable services for children with degenerative illness and their families. They provide a space for family bonding as well as mourning and I am grateful that such organisations exist today. I first learned about this organisation when looking for volunteering opportunities in London. Following my experience volunteering with a hospice in Toronto, I came to  believe strongly in palliative care. 

I made a display plush of their beloved mascot, Dotty, so they could use it for fundraising or display purposes. The first image is the display plush I made and the other two images are of their mascot. I hope you like it!
