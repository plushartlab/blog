Following my Dotty project for Demelza Hospice for Children, I was excited to get started on to my next project, an elephant plush for [Friends of Age Exchange](:http://www.age-exchange.org.uk/).

Age Exchange is a charity that provides training of an innovative form of art therapy called Reminiscence Arts, involving music, drama, dance, crafts, etc.,  to engage people with dementia and trigger long term memory. You can read more about reminiscence arts [here](http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/oct/22/dementia-multi-sensory-therapy-reminiscence-arts). 

Friends of Age Exchange supports and raises funds for Age Exchange. They act as a community hub in Blackheath Village by running a cafe/library and they hold the  well attended Christmas Fair.

This Elephant plush is to be used as a mascot of Friends of Age Exchange! It was based on the elephant on their Christmas fair poster.

Update 14/12/2016:

Here are some pictures of the elephant that Marion of Friends of Age Exchange was kind enough to share! In order from left to right: Sunday Art & Craft Sale (earlier in 2016), Christmas Fair (December, 2016),  Santa's Grotto (December, 2016, last two).
