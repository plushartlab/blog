Recently I added embroidered to order [tshirts](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1028898070/personalised-unisex-organic-fairtrade?ref=shop_home_active_33) and [tote bags](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1043181305/personalised-fairtrade-organic-cotton?ref=shop_home_active_32) to the shop! The designs were digitsed by me for machine embroidery and the text can be personalised to your liking. 

I tried to find the best t-shirt and tote bag in quality and environmental impact I could. They are 100% Organic Fairtrade Cotton, and have accreditations, including EU Ecolabel, fairtrade cotton, OEXO-TEX Standard 100, and Social accountability accreditation. 

The t-shirt is single jersey knit, made of soft ringspun 185gsm combed cotton, and the tote bag is made from heavyweigth 210gsm twill weaved organic Fairtrade cotton.
