Remember Henry the Hound? Henry was a mascot plush I made for Haven House Children's Hospice. In addition to the mascot plush, I had agreed to make a plush for the winner of their Summer art contest, which was held in July. Children paid 50p to participate (which was to raise money for art supplies for art therapy services provided by the hospice) and the winner was chosen by the hospice. The winning drawing was Buttons.

I tried to make the plush in likeness of the drawing. Buttons is made out of cuddle fabric, so he/she is soft and cuddly. I added some buttons to the heart, and used wooden buttons for the pants and the ribbon on the ear. For the text on the shirt, I appliqu√©d letters cut out of orange cuddle fabric onto raspberry cuddle base. The colours of cuddle/plush fabric is as follows: Paris Pink (heart on cheek), Raspberry (top), Aqua (pants), Cappuccino (teddy fur), Orange (text on top), Brown (bow). I hope the winning artist will like the plush version of her design!
