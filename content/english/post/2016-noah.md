Finally finished with the display plush for Noah's Ark! Along with Haven House and Demelza, Noah's Ark Children's Hospice provides end of life care for children in London. To find out more about the important services they provide, have a look at their [website](http://www.noahsarkhospice.org.uk/). 

It's taken awhile. The base is  high density foam covered in felted wool.It was my first time  wet felting and I think I may have been  too timid with the soap water mixture. Next time, I will use hotter water and also put in more soap. I put 2tsp of wool soap shavings in 1.5L of warm water. It wasn't a complete disaster; the wool did lock in place enough that it stayed on the foam but I think there is room for improvement.

I made the boat out of wool felt, and put in a cardboard piece in the base to stabilise the shape. The sides were filled with polyester toy filling, and the boy, girl, and the giraffe house I've shared before.

This project turned out more similar to the logo than Henry the hound for Haven House, so I'm happy about that!

The plush was used for fundraising during Hospice Care week in October of 2016.
