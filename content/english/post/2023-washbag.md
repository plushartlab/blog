New to the shop are [washbags](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PlushArtLab?ref=seller-platform-mcnav&section_id=24184919) embroidered to order. The designs were digitised by me for machine embroidery and the text can be personalised to your liking, like the tote bags and tshirts. 

The washbags are useful for holding cosmetics, toiletries or medications, even cables and chargers for your electronics, memory card, pens, etc., especially while traveling to keep everything organised. 

It is made of premium 100% organic material, has a zippered closure, and is certified by Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS).
