My latest project for charity was for The Triangle, a community hub in Crystal Palace run by Barnardo's charity for children. The Triangle has a large play area and conference rooms for hire with proceeds going toward their work with vulnerable children.

â€‹As part of their Summer programme, they contacted me about making a piece based on the winning designs of their "design a bear" activity and I agreed to take part! I made an embroidery version of the coloured bears and framed it in a green wood, to keep in line with Barnardo's logo colour. Take a peek below!
