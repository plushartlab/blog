I just completed a custom order for a doll of Jeff Lynne for a lovely lady. I thought I would share some of my thinking behind the design!

To create the doll, I received a photo of Lynne performing at Glastonbury in 2016 so I based the doll's outfit on pictures from this event. I wanted to find out what kind of guitar he generally prefers, and I found this bit of an interview by Joe Bosso from 2012: 

I'm sure you have a pretty nice collection of guitars from over the years. Do you have a tight little set of go-to models?

"... My favorite guitar is a '58 Strat - and the Tele, which is really an Esquire converted to a Tele... "

So, since he prefers the Fender Stratocaster and the Fender Telecaster, Lars 3D printed a Fender style guitar for the doll using his Prusa printer based on this design:

For the doll stand, I embroidered a line from his song Mr Blue Sky: " Mister blue sky, please tell us why you had to hide away for so long, where did we go wrong?", and for the central design, I embroidered ELO, sticking to the colours of the original logo. 

And of course, the ever present sunglasses had to be included. These were based on this design:
