Another mascot plush! I made this mascot plush for Follow Your Dreams. They work to provide opportunities for young people with learning disabilities to encourage them to follow their dreams. They do this by providing workshops and supporting meet ups for these young people and their families.

This cheerful plush is made out of cuddle fabric and the eyes and mouth were hand embroidered. I don't have an embroidery machine so I wasn't sure what to do about the big eyes. I thought of using fleece but then I tried to mimic the effect of eyes done on an embroidery machine by hand. It took a long time but it's effective!
